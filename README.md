SORRY. The login / register page wouldn't let me in so I couldn't really test much.
-27 can't test functionality because database error occured: Warning: mysqli::__construct(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in /home/misschris98/public_html/database.php on line 11 Connection Failed: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

-2 I didn't see filtering input (html_entities), but I was skimming at this point.

-5 csrf tokens not implemented

-10 couldn't test creative portion, didn't see likes in the sql tables implemented anywhere

Please ask for regrade once the database authentication is fixed.
